# Notion Clone – Learning by Building

This is a personal learning project where I'm building a Notion-like application from scratch to deepen my understanding of full-stack development.

Notion is a software that I love and has many hard challenges in Frontend and backend so that's why I chose this app to make a clon.

### 🧠 Goal

The purpose of this project is **learning by doing** — not just building features, but understanding how things work under the hood. I'm using this as a real-world playground to apply best practices in:

- Complex state management
- Clean frontend architecture
- REST API design
- React optimization (memoization, useMemo, React.memo)
- Scalable architecture patterns (backend & frontend)
- Error handling systems
- Database structure and query strategies

### ⚙️ Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Context API, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Express.js, PostgreSQL
- **Database**: SQL relational model
- **Auth**: JWT authentication
- **Architecture**: Layered structure (Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories)

### ✍️ Learning in Progress

This project is **under active development**, and I’m constantly improving the architecture and refactoring the code to make it scalable, robust, and clean. Some key ideas I’m exploring:

- Optimizing render performance
- Error handling flow from DB → API → Client
- Nested pages logic and tree rendering
- Page editing synced with DB
- SSR
- Real time updates
- Auth sessions
- Many more

### 🚧 Status

This project is still in progress. Core features like page creation, nesting, editing, and real-time syncing are being built step by step. I'm focusing on building a solid foundation rather than rushing features.

Feel free to explore the code and follow my learning journey! 🙂
